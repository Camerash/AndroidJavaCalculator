# Android Java Calculator
Skeleton code for Android Calculator, written in Java.

## Introduction :information_source: 
In this test, you are required to create a calculator app on Android! :tada: :iphone: 

## Requirements :notebook: 
- Perform basic calculation :heavy_plus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x: :heavy_division_sign: 
    - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
    - Between two input real numbers (both integers and floats) :1234:

- Clear input and result (by the `C` button)

- Display current user input
    - Simple equation with actions involving two numbers are already sufficient
    - E.g.: 135 + 252.5

- Display result of equation when user hit `=` button

- Error checking for user inputs :computer: 
    - Do nothing when `=` is hit if error is present

## Restrictions :no_entry: 
- You cannot use any external library :alien: :no_entry_sign: 
    - E.g. `Expr4J`

- Copying other's work or source code is strictly prohibited :angry: (Except for the skeleton codes we provide)
    - Once found, the related intervieww will be immediately disqualified
    - We take integrity seriously here in USThing, so please don't cheat :wink:
    - Using your own work is fine, but you need to provide the proof of ownership

## Resources :heart_eyes:
- We have prepare a few skeleton project and codes for you, you are welcome to:
    - Clone the existing skeleton project on GitHub (Environment-ready)
    - Download the individual files by downloading the zip on the GitHub Repositories and grab what you need
    
        - [Java Calculator Skeleton Project](https://github.com/Camerash/AndroidJavaCalculator)
        - [Kotlin Calculator Skeleton Project](https://github.com/Camerash/AndroidKotlinCalculator)

    - Write from scratch! :ghost:

## Checkpoints :checkered_flag: 
- [x] Grab user input with numpad click
- [x] Implement calculation logic
- [x] Check user input validity when `=` button is clicked
- [x] Display Anwser
- [x] Clear input and result when `C` button is clicked
